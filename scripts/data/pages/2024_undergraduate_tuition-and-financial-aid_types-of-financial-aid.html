        Federal Work-Study employment is available to students on the basis of demonstrated financial need and is counted as a form of need-based financial aid. Student employees are paid as a result of working part-time in a position either on- or off-campus. The wages of students participating in this program are subsidized with federal funds.

        Federal Direct Loan
       </h3>
       <p class="cat-catp line-58 xind-3">
        Funds from this program are made available to students from the U.S. Department of Education. The loan can be either subsidized or unsubsidized, or a combination of both. The maximum amount a student can borrow from this program in an academic year depends on the student's year in school (i.e., freshman, sophomore, etc.); whether the student is considered to be dependent or independent for the purposes of financial aid; the student's total cost of attendance as determined by the school; and what other forms of financial aid the student is receiving. To qualify for a subsidized Federal Direct Loan the student must demonstrate financial need. The federal government pays the interest on a subsidized Federal Direct Loan as long as the student remains enrolled in school at least half-time. The unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan is available for students who do not demonstrate financial need and for students who need more funding than is available with the subsidized Federal Direct Loan. Students who borrow an unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan are charged interest while they are enrolled in school. Students completing a

       </h3>
       <p class="cat-catp line-62 xind-3">
        The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides up to $4,000 per year ($16,000 total for four-year programs) in grants to students who intend to teach full-time in high-need subject areas for at least four years at schools that serve students from low-income families. The maximum award is subject to reduction by Congress.
       </p>
       <p class="cat-catp line-63 xind-3">
        Eligible students must be enrolled in coursework that is necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such coursework. Coursework that will prepare a student to teach in a high-need subject area (e.g., math courses for a student who intends to be a math teacher) is acceptable.
       </p>
       <p class="cat-catp line-64 xind-3">
        Eligible students must meet the following academic achievement requirements of either scoring above the 75th percentile on either the SAT or the ACT or graduating from high school with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.250 on a 4.000 scale. Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.250 throughout the academic program for which they receive a TEACH Grant.
       </p>
       <p class="cat-catp line-65 xind-3">
        Eligible students must complete TEACH Grant counseling and sign a "TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve." The TEACH Grant service agreement specifies the conditions under which the grant will be awarded, the teaching service requirements, and includes an acknowledgement by the student that if the required teaching service obligation is not met, TEACH Grant funds will be converted to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan that must be repaid, with interest charged from the date of each TEACH Grant disbursement.
       </p>
       <p class="cat-catp line-66 xind-3">
        To apply for the TEACH Grant you must submit the FAFSA. Additional information regarding the program can be found at
