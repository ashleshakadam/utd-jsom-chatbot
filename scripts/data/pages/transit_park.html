          All deductions are pretax and deducted over a period of one to nine months, depending on the date of sale.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is no deadline to sign up for payroll deduction, however, to be eligible to be on the nine-month deduction plan, employees need to apply no later than September 10. For those enrolling by September 10, deductions will begin on the October 1 paycheck.
         </p>
         <p>
          Those that purchase their permit via payroll deduction later in the fiscal year will have the total number of deductions reduced to meet the annual payment date. Please note that the monthly deduction amount will increase to meet the annual payment date, meaning the later an employee applies for payroll deduction, the fewer deductions they may have, but they may in turn have a higher monthly amount deducted.

 Students may register two (2) vehicles to their virtual permit and employees
 may register five (5) vehicles to their virtual permit; however, only

 verified for registration. Please note vehicles can be requested to be updated up
 to three times per semester. Exchanging vehicles on your permit more frequently may
 be denied.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is essential that all vehicle information is kept up-to-date to avoid receiving
 a citation. Please log into your parking account to update your information immediately
 after any change to your license plate or vehicle. In the event that you drive a
 different vehicle to campus, you will also need to ensure that it is currently
 registered to your permit before parking on campus.

        Parking permits may not be purchased, transferred or obtained from any source or party
 other than the UT Dallas Parking and Transportation Office. Displaying or registering
 a parking permit that belongs to another customer is strictly prohibited and may lead
 to vehicle immobilization and additional fees and penalties.

               Annual parking permits are prorated in cost throughout the academic year. For faculty and staff, permits are prorated on the first of each month.

               Annual parking permit purchases are valid from the date of purchase through August 31 of the current academic year.

               Annual permits can be purchased at any time online at

               by logging with your NetID. A payment method can be selected at the time of check-out. Permits are available for purchase via credit/debit card as an in-full payment, or via monthly payroll deduction for eligible employees.
              </li>
              <li>
               Annual permits are eligible for refund if purchased in full. Refund amount will be determined by the date of return through the end of the fiscal year. Permits purchased via payroll deduction are “pay as you go” and are not eligible for refund, but may be canceled to prevent future deductions.

              <li>
               Faculty and staff may only purchase one annual parking permit online. If a second permit is needed, please

        UT Dallas is now utilizing virtual permits for all parking options on campus. This system
 utilizes License Plate Recognition
 (

 for physical stickers and allows all permit holders to easily add and maintain vehicles
 on their accounts.

        </abbr>
        )
 is camera-based technology that quickly scans multiple vehicle license plates. This
 technology allows us to transition to virtual permits by allowing a vehicle’s
 license plate to serve in place of a sticker or decal permit. LPR cameras can scan your
 license plate to check if you have appropriate parking permissions, which eliminates
 the need to place a physical permit on your windshield. LPR is a mobile system that uses
 vehicle-mounted cameras to scan license plates and verify virtual permits in all lots
 and garages on campus.
       </p>
       <p>
        Virtual Permits will be beneficial to our campus as they eliminate the need to move
 your permit between multiple vehicles. They also support sustainability by reducing
 paper usage, ink, and plastic used for permit distribution and postage.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can register your vehicles to your Virtual Permit through the online Parking Portal.
 To register a vehicle online, log in to your
        <a href="https://services.utdallas.edu/transit/myparking/" title="MyParking">
         MyParking
        </a>
        account and select the vehicles tab. You will then
 be able to add a vehicle by entering the license plate and other vehicle details.
 Students may register two (2) vehicles to their virtual permit and employees
 may register five (5) vehicles to their virtual permit; however, only one
 vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. Parking more than one vehicle on
 campus at one time may lead to citations. The current fine amount for parking multiple vehicles on campus is $100, per vehicle.

        All virtual permits are non-transferable and can only be used by the individual
 to whom it is assigned. Permit sharing is prohibited and may lead to parking citations
 and/or vehicle immobilization.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is essential that all vehicle information is kept up-to-date to avoid receiving
 an unnecessary citation. Please log into your parking account to update your information
 immediately after any change to your license plate or vehicle. In the event that you
 drive a different vehicle to campus, you will also need to ensure that it is currently
 registered to your permit before parking on campus.

        UT Dallas Parking &amp; Transportation Services utilizes vehicle state registration from the Texas Department of Transportation to determine relationships between vehicles and drivers.

        If you no longer own a vehicle, it is imperative that you properly transfer the
 vehicle to the new owner. Failing to properly transfer a vehicle into the buyer’s
 name could result in the seller being held responsible for tickets, toll violations,
 or even crimes committed with the vehicle. To ensure this doesn’t happen to
 you,
        <strong>
         accompany the buyer to your county tax office to ensure a vehicle title
 application is filed

        A dealer is not required to title in the dealership’s name if you sell or
 trade-in your vehicle to a licensed motor vehicle dealer. The vehicle stays in your
 name until it is sold to an individual, which may take months or in some cases, years.
 To protect yourself, file a

 for parking tickets that have been committed by the person who purchased
 the vehicle.

          The University of Texas at Dallas does not allow University departments to pay for parking permits for individual University employees using University funds. Departments may purchase a parking permit that is owned by the department and used by multiple individuals as needed. The purpose of a departmental permit is not to replace the need for employees to purchase their own parking permit, but to facilitate ease of parking when employees are performing their job duties on campus. It is the responsibility of the department head or their designee to ensure departmental passes are used appropriately. Departmental permits must be purchased via

          Vehicle Impoundment Process:
         </strong>
         Vehicles meeting any of the above
 vehicle impoundment guidelines may be booted or towed at the owner’s expense.
 The University of Texas at Dallas is not responsible for any damage to a vehicle during

         <strong>
          Booting:
         </strong>
         The owner or driver of a booted vehicle may recover
 the vehicle after paying a $75 booting fee. The booting fee can be paid at the
 Parking Office during regular business hours or any time through the online
         <a href="https://services.utdallas.edu/transit/booting/" title="parking portal">
          parking portal
         </a>
         . The boot fee is not appealable, nor refundable. Students, faculty and staff may log into
 the parking portal by using their UTD NetID and password. Non-affiliates may log into
 the
         <a href="https://services.utdallas.edu/transit/booting/" title="parking portal">
          parking portal
         </a>
         by creating a guest account. The owner or driver
 of a booted vehicle must also complete a boot release form at the Parking Office.
 A valid driver’s license is required to complete a boot release form and have a
 vehicle released. If the Parking Office is closed, the owner or driver can call UTD Police
 at
         <a href="tel:+1-972-883-2222" title="Call 972.883.2222">
          972.883.2222
         </a>
         and an officer will meet you at the vehicle.
 A valid driver’s license is required to complete a boot release form and have a
 vehicle released. The owner or driver of a booted vehicle has 24 hours from the time
 the vehicle is booted to pay the booting fee and claim a booted vehicle.
         <strong>
          Booted
 vehicles will be towed off campus at the owner’s expense if the booting fee
 is not paid and the vehicle claimed within 24 hours from the time the vehicle
 is booted.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Booted vehicles are not allowed to park on UT Dallas property (this includes metered
 parking areas) after the boot is released until all citations are paid or a payment
 plan is established with Parking and Transportation Services. Previously booted vehicles
 are subject to towing if parked on UT Dallas property without paying all outstanding citations,
 or if the owner or driver defaults on a previously established payment plan or does not
 make payments on time.
