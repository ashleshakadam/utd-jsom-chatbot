      Report an Incident

     <h2>
      Hazing Defined
     </h2>
     <p>
      The 70th Texas Legislature enacted a law concerning hazing. Under the law, individuals or organizations
          engaging in hazing could be subject to fines and charged with a criminal offense.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the law, a person can commit a hazing offense not only by engaging in a hazing activity, but
          also by soliciting, directing, encouraging, aiding or attempting to aid another in hazing; by intentionally,
          knowingly or recklessly allowing hazing to occur; or by failing to report, in writing to the Dean of Students
          or another appropriate official of the institution, first-hand knowledge that a hazing incident is planned or
          has occurred. The fact that a person consented to or acquiesced in a hazing activity is not a defense to
          prosecution for hazing under this law.
     </p>
     <p>
      In an effort to encourage reporting of hazing incidents, the law grants immunity from civil or criminal
          liability to any person who reports a specific hazing event in good faith and without malice to the Dean of
          Students or other appropriate official of the institution and immunizes that person for participation in any
          judicial proceeding resulting from liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result of the
          report. The penalty for failure to report is a fine of up to $1,000, up to 180 days in jail, or both.
          Penalties for other hazing offenses vary according to the severity of the injury which results and include
          fines from $500 to $10,000 and/or confinement for up to two years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The law defines hazing as:
      <strong>
       any intentional, knowing or reckless act, occurring on or off the campus
            of an educational institution, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that
            endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated
            into, affiliating with, holding office in or maintaining membership in any organization whose members are
            or include students at an educational institution.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Hazing includes but is not limited to:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       any type of physical brutality, such as whipping, beating, striking, branding, electric shocking, placing
            of a harmful substance on the body or similar activity;
      </li>
      <li>
       any type of physical activity, such as sleep deprivation, exposure to the elements, confinement in a
            small space, calisthenics, or other activity that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or
            that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student;
      </li>
      <li>
       any activity involving consumption of food, liquid, alcoholic beverage, liquor, drug or other substance
            which subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or which adversely affects the mental or
            physical health of the student;
      </li>
      <li>
       any activity that intimidates or threatens the student with ostracism, that subjects the student to
            extreme mental stress, shame or humiliation, or that adversely affects the mental health or dignity of the
            student or discourages the student from entering or remaining registered in an educational institution, or
            that may reasonably be expected to cause a student to leave the organization or the institution rather than
            submit to acts described in this subsection;
      </li>
      <li>
       any activity that induces, causes or requires the student to perform a duty or task which involves a
            violation of the Penal Code.
      </li>
