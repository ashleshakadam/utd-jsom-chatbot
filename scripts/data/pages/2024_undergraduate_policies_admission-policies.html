      <p class="cat-catp line-6 xind-3">
       Petitioning examination of credit is recommended to be completed within the student's first term at UT Dallas, but not later than the first day of the student's graduating term. A first-year student must weigh the advantages of accepting college credit through examinations against the possible impact such credit might have on tuition rebate eligibility and their readiness for subsequent courses in an academic sequence.
      </p>
      <p class="cat-catp line-7 xind-3">

       . UT Dallas must receive an official score report from the testing agency that provided the examination. UT Dallas does not accept examination credit from other higher education institutions' transcripts. As credit is petitioned after admission, credit by examination is not considered as part of an applicant's transferable GPA or transfer hours for admissions.

       Criminal Background Check
      </h3>
      <p class="cat-catp line-12 xind-3">
       Certain programs require students to submit to and satisfactorily complete a background check review as a condition of admission and/or participation in education experiences. Students who refuse to submit to a background check or who do not pass the background check may be dismissed from the program. The student is responsible for the costs associated with the criminal background check.

        Section 51.803

       of the Texas Education Code, students are automatically admitted to the University as first-time freshmen if they graduate in the top 10% of their class from an accredited Texas high school, and, in accordance with

       of the Texas Education Code, successfully complete the Distinguished Level of Achievement, as applicable. Applicants must have graduated from high school during one of the two school years preceding the academic year for which they seek admission as first-time freshmen and have not attempted any higher education credits since graduation from high school. Pursuant to Texas Education Code, Sections 51.803 and 51.805, and high school applicants have met one of the following conditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li class="cat-catli line-19 xind-5">
        successfully completed the distinguished level of achievement under the Foundation Program from a Texas public high school;
       </li>

       Meeting the minimum requirements makes a student eligible for automatic admission but exceeding the minimum is often necessary for applicants to be competitive to the many of the University's academic programs. The high school curriculum requirements will be documented through the application process. Applicants admitted because they are in the top 10% of their high school class may be required to complete additional preparatory work before enrolling in the University or complete developmental coursework to remove any deficiencies in their readiness to successfully complete college-level work prior to University graduation.

       The University may accept transfer credit only for academic post-secondary coursework completed with a grade of C (2.000 on a 4.000 -point scale) or higher. Pass/Fail grades are reviewed to determine if they meet the 2.000 threshold. The University of Texas at Dallas does not offer credit for developmental studies, nor does it grant credit for prior experiential learning. Some degree programs offer credit for applied sciences and applied technology coursework. Please note: if a student transfers majors at UT Dallas, some transfer credits from applied sciences and applied technology degrees might not be applicable to the new major. Coursework that is accepted for transfer credit is applicable toward satisfying requirements for a specific UT Dallas major according to the same criteria as those used for equivalent UT Dallas courses.

       The application of transfer credit to degree plans must be completed within the first semester of enrollment.

         Developmental Education at UT Dallas

        <p class="cat-catp line-143 xind-3">
         Students who are required to take the TSI Assessment and do not score at the college readiness levels will be required to register for Developmental Education courses for all areas in which they did not achieve the stated cut-score. UT Dallas does not offer Developmental Education coursework, so registration for Developmental Education can be done at a community college of the students' choosing. Students must work with their UT Dallas School academic advisor and the UT Dallas TSI coordinator to ensure they are properly enrolled in courses at UT Dallas as well as Developmental Education courses at a local community college. If at any time during the semester a student is in violation of this policy, the student may be dropped from their UTD course(s).
         <strong>
          Note: UTD requires students be TSI complete prior to upper lever coursework beyond 59 credit hours.

         UT Dallas students may enroll in Developmental Education courses at a local community college of their choosing. Students should discuss this with their UT Dallas School academic advisor and the UT Dallas TSI coordinator. Students are required to successfully complete the developmental coursework sequence at the community college to become TSI complete. A student can only become TSI complete if they have completed the highest level of the developmental education coursework at the community college or until they reach the college-ready standard on the TSI Assessment.
