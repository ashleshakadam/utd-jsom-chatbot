       UT Dallas offers rigorous university-based teacher certification curricula and enjoys an outstanding reputation for producing excellent teachers.
      </p>
      <p class="cat-catp line-4 xind-2">
       At UT Dallas, coursework and field experiences leading to teacher certification may be accomplished through either the Teacher Development Center (TDC) program in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies (972-883-2730) or through UTeach Dallas program in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (NS&amp;M) (972-883-2496). In coordination with a student's academic major in other UT Dallas academic programs, students develop the content expertise required in a teaching field such as Early Childhood Education, Literature, History, Mathematics, and Science. Both programs utilize the total resources of the University rather than relying on a school of education. Students interested in pursuing teacher certification through UT Dallas should review program requirements for the TDC and UTeach Dallas. Although each program provides the same curricular content as required by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB), the programs are uniquely independent, not interchangeable, and differ in course design and some requirements. Both SBEC and THECB have approved the content and procedures for both programs' curricula.

       UT Dallas undergraduate and graduate students may earn their teaching certificates concurrently with their degree studies. Also, through the UTeach Dallas program, undergraduate students can earn a

Additionally, graduate students may choose to pursue teacher certification without formal degree studies as a non-degree seeking graduate student in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies or in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics through TDC or UTeach Dallas, respectively The Master of Arts in Teaching programs in

      <p class="cat-catp line-6 xind-2">
       After developing a degree plan with their academic major advisor, undergraduate students may apply to the TDC for admission to the teacher certification program. A certification plan will be developed with the student and the TDC advisor. Students enrolling in UTeach Dallas should meet with the UTeach Dallas advisor who also serves as an NS&amp;M academic advisor

       Early Childhood - Grade 6 Core Subjects Certification
      </h3>
      <p class="cat-catp line-29 xind-3">
       The "Core Subjects EC-6" teacher certificate may only be earned through the TDC certification track. It is the only certification available to students interested in these grade levels. The TExES content examination for this certification tests for broad-based content mastery. Therefore, students are counseled to work with academic advisors in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies or the School of Brain and Behavioral Sciences if they seek "Core Subjects EC-6" certification. Because most school districts now seek or require EC-6 teachers to have ESL or bilingual supplemental certification, the TDC highly recommends students seeking this certification to prepare for and take the ESL Supplemental TExES examination when certified by TEA. Students seeking certification in EC-6 Core Subjects must pass the state required TExES examination, the Science of Teaching Reading.

Post-baccalaureate students should consult with a TDC or UTeach Dallas (secondary STEM certification seekers) advisor to develop a certification plan after their admission to the University through the Office of Admission and Enrollment. Post-baccalaureate students who are seeking certification only and not concurrently pursuing a graduate degree are considered "alternative certification" students by the Texas Education Agency.

If a student is seeking certification concurrently with a graduate program such as the Master of Arts in Teaching Science/Mathematics Education, they will be enrolled as an alternative certification student per the Texas Education Agency due to the fact that most students will graduate with the master's program prior to completing certification.  However, if graduation from the master's program occurs after completing the teaching certificate, students will need to contact TDC to change their certification designation to post-baccalaureate.  The advisor will assist the student with this process.

       Post-baccalaureate students must meet the 24 semester credit hour requirements for their chosen content area and required professional education coursework. A certification plan based on an analysis of the candidate's transcript will be developed. If additional content coursework is necessary, the candidate may take the required courses in their content area at the graduate or undergraduate level. Candidates must demonstrate technology literacy, online education literacy, and effective public speaking. TDC students must complete a total of 12 semester credit hours of English language, composition, and/or literature.
