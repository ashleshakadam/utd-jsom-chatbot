            I hold a Ph.D. in âSpanish Linguisticsâ from the Universidad de Sevilla, Spain, and I joined the
					School of Arts &amp; Humanities at The University of Texas at Dallas in 2016 as Director of the Spanish
					Language Program. In 2019, I was named Director of Languages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before joining UT Dallas, I taught, coordinated and designed several Spanish Language courses at
					Princeton University. Over the last two decades, I have had the opportunity to teach, coordinate,
					design and create a wide variety of specialized Spanish Language, Literature and Culture courses in
					Spain, Singapore, Slovakia and the United States, and in different teaching contexts. During these
					years, the invaluable constant interaction and dialogue with students and colleagues has made me
					grow as a teacher and as an educator.
           </p>
           <p>
            Learning a foreign language means seeing the world through the eyes of another culture and
					understanding the differences between both. That is why I believe affective component and motivation
					are very important elements for both interaction and the teaching/learning process. As a facilitator
					of the learning process, my goal is to make autonomous learners who can manage their own learning.
           </p>
           <p>
            My research focuses on the difficulties in the treatment of certain linguistic mechanisms in Spanish
					for both teachers and learners, as well as the search for more effective approaches and strategies
					that facilitate the learning process and improve learnersâ communicative competence. My areas of
					interest include Second Language Acquisition, Teaching Methodology, Language Pedagogy, Curriculum
					Design and Cognitive Linguistics.

            Maisie Heiken is a transformational leader with global experience in fields spanning from strategic management and corporate governance to international marketing and wealth management. Born and raised in Hong Kong, her early career included marketing representation for Caterpillar Inc. from its Southeast Asia headquarters in Hong Kong, its EMEA hub in Geneva, and its global headquarters in Peoria, Illinois.
           </p>
           <p>
            With her move to the United States, Maisie earned a degree in finance from the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, and gained the professional designation, Certified Investment Management Analyst CIMAÃ, provided by the Investments and Wealth Institute. That led to a twenty-seven-year career with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch as a senior vice president of wealth management and portfolio management. In that position, she independently built her book of business from the ground up, using a client contact management system that she developed eight years before Merrill Lynch engaged the services of SalesForce. Her performance metrics consistently ranked among the top 1% of advisors in the industry, and in the first quintile of the firm, and was ranked by BARRONâS among the Top 1,000 advisors in the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maisieâs C-suite executive clients trusted her to achieve their long-term financial goals with an abiding sense of fiduciary responsibility. Her recommendations were based on riskassessment-first, results-secondary, custom-tailored portfolio management models, rooted in qualitative and quantitative economic research. This duty of care was particularly important during the Y2K and 2008 financial crises, when steering away from high-yielding, risky assets was prudent and necessary.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2019, applying the same analytical skills to her personal life, Maisie retired from Merrill Lynch and relocated from Scottsdale Arizona to Dallas Texas. Currently, in addition to her professional advisory activities, she provides community service on boards and advisory councils for the Mayo Clinic, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and its Foundation, the World Affairs Council of DFW, and the University of Texas at Dallas, through its Center for Brain Health, Jindal School of Management, and Center for Global Business.
           </p>
           <p>
            With traits of creativity, enthusiasm, transparency, loyalty, and a strong work ethic, Maisie Heikenâs professional and life experience spans three continents. Her interpersonal and executive skills in marketing, finance, corporate governance, and technical innovation are valued by organizations that seek effective solutions to complex problems.
