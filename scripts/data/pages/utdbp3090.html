         A. Policy Statement
        </h5>
        <p>
         The University of Texas at Dallas is committed to providing an educational, living and working environment that is welcoming, respectful and inclusive of all members of the university community. An environment that is free of discrimination and harassment allows members of the university community to excel in their academic and professional careers. To that end, to the extent provided by applicable federal and state law, the University prohibits unlawful discrimination against a person because of their race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or veteran status.
        </p>
        <p>
         The University also requires faculty, staff and student employees to complete non-discrimination training as required by federal, state and university regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Retaliation against a person who files a claim of discrimination, participates in a discrimination investigation or proceeding, or otherwise opposes an unlawful employment practice is prohibited.
        </p>
        <h5 id="b-scope">
         B. Scope
        </h5>
        <p>
         This policy applies to visitors, applicants for admission to or employment with the University, and students and employees of the university who allege discrimination by university employees, students, visitors, or contractors. Complaints of full-time faculty who are notified that they will not be reappointed, or that the subsequent academic year will be their terminal appointment, and who contend that such decisions were made for unlawfully discriminatory reasons will be referred to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost for handling pursuant to the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System.
        </p>
        <h5 id="c-definitions">

           Discrimination
          </i>
          is defined as conduct directed at a specific individual or a group of identifiable individuals that subjects the individual or group to treatment that adversely affects their employment or education because of their race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender expression or gender identity.

         </li>
         <li>
          <i>

        </h5>
        <ol>
         <li>
          The University provides training to all newly hired employees on the institutional policies and procedures that prohibit discrimination. This training must be completed no later than (30) thirty days after the date of hire. Completion of this training by all newly hired UT Dallas employees is mandatory.
         </li>
         <li>

         </li>
         <li>
          If an electronic means of verifying completion of required training is not available, employees will be required to sign a statement verifying the employee's completion of the required training.

          Failure to complete the mandatory training required by this policy will be noted by the employee's supervisor in the employee's next performance evaluation.

        <h5 id="b-reporting">
         B. Reporting
        </h5>
        <p>
         A person who believes that they have been subjected to discrimination or harassment in violation of this policy should report the incident to any university official, administrator, or supervisor. A faculty member is not an "official, administrator, or supervisor" for this purpose unless that faculty member holds an administrative position. Students, employees, and campus visitors are encouraged to report such incidents to the Office of Institutional Compliance (“IC”). Incidents should be reported as soon as possible after the time of their occurrence, which in most cases will be within thirty (30) calendar days. No person is required to report discrimination or harassment to the alleged offender.

        <p>
         It is the responsibility of every supervisor, administrator, and University official to promptly report incidents of discrimination and harassment in violation of this policy that come to their attention even if the employee is not in their reporting structure.

        </h5>
        <p>
         A person who believes they have been subjected to discrimination or harassment in violation of this policy and seeks to take action may use either the informal resolution process or the formal complaint process, or both. The informal resolution and formal complaint process described in this policy are not mutually exclusive and neither is required as a pre-condition for choosing the other; however, they cannot both be used at the same time.

         E. Complaints Against Students
        </h5>
        <p>
         All complaints against students, except for those that fall under the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy – UTDBP3102, will be initially addressed by the Dean of Students Office. The Dean of Students, or designee, will attempt to address the complaint through informal resolution as outlined below. If attempts at informal resolution are unsuccessful, the complaint will be forwarded to IC and a formal investigation will be initiated, if appropriate.

         A. Informal Resolution
        </h5>
        <p>
         Informal resolution may be an appropriate choice when the conduct involved is not of a serious or repetitive nature and disciplinary action is not anticipated to be required to remedy the situation. No formal investigation is involved in the informal resolution process.
        </p>
        <p>
         A request for informal resolution should be reported as soon as possible after the occurrence of the incident, which in most cases will be within thirty (30) calendar days, to IC ,who shall determine whether the nature of the problem is such that it can be resolved by agreement on an informal basis. Methods for informal resolution may include, but are not limited to: coaching the person on how to directly address a situation that is causing a problem; mediating the dispute with the parties; aiding in the modification of a situation in which the offensive conduct occurred; assisting a department or division with the resolution of a real or perceived problem; or arranging a documented meeting with the alleged offender that involves a discussion of the requirements of the Nondiscrimination Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The University shall document any informal resolution. Such documentation shall be retained by the Dean of Students Office or IC, as appropriate, and will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. An informal resolution meeting shall not be considered a precondition for the filing of a formal complaint.

If the Complainant is a member of the faculty, the appeal will be forwarded to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost. The request for appeal must be a signed written document articulating why the decision to dismiss the complaint was in error. The appropriate vice president will respond within twenty (20) business days of receipt of the appeal. If the decision to dismiss is upheld, that decision is final. If the decision to dismiss is overturned, the complaint is sent back to IC for investigation in accordance with the procedures outlined below.
