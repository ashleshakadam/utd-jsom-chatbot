      Academic Dishonesty:
     </strong>
    </em>
    Academic dishonesty can occur in relation to any type of work submitted for academic credit or as a requirement for a class. It can include individual work or a group project. Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, and collaboration/collusion. In order to avoid academic dishonesty, it is important for students to fully understand the expectations of their professors. This is best accomplished through asking clarifying questions if an individual does not completely understand the requirements of an assignment.

    Email Use
   </h3>
   <p>
    UT Dallas recognizes the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. All official student email correspondence will be sent only to a student's UT Dallas email address and UT Dallas will only consider email requests originating from an official UT Dallas student email account. This allows the University to maintain a high degree of confidence in the identity of each individual corresponding via email and the security of the transmitted information. UT Dallas furnishes each student with a free email account that is to be used in all communication with university personnel.

Regular and punctual class attendance is expected regardless of course modality. Students who fail to attend class regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. In some courses, instructors may have special attendance requirements; these should be made known to students during the first week of classes.

    Regular class participation is expected regardless of course modality. Students who fail to participate in class regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. A portion of the grade in the course is directly tied to class participation. It also includes students' engagement in group or other activities during class that solicit feedback on homework assignments, readings, and/or materials covered in the lectures and/or labs. Class participation is documented by faculty. Successful class participation is defined as consistently adhering to University requirements, as presented in the syllabus.

    UT Dallas will excuse a student from class or other required activities, including examinations and travel time, for the observance of a religious holy day for a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property tax under Section 11.20, of the
    <em>
     Texas Tax Code
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Students are encouraged to notify the instructor or activity sponsor as soon as possible regarding the absence, preferably in advance of the assignment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Excused students will be allowed to take missed exams or complete assignments within a reasonable time after the absence: a period equal to the length of the absence, up to a maximum of one week. A student who notifies the instructor and completes any missed exam or assignment may not be penalized for the absence. A student who fails to complete the exam or assignment within the prescribed period may receive a failing grade for that exam or assignment.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a student or an instructor disagrees about the nature of the absence [i.e., for the purpose of observing a religious holy day] or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor may request a ruling from the school's vice or associate dean, who serve as the President's designees for these rules. The vice or associate deans must take into account the legislative intent of
    <em>

    Making a False Alarm or Report Involving a Public or Private Institution of a Higher Education
   </h3>
   <p>
    Making a false threat at any Texas higher education institution is considered a
    <strong>
     State Jail Felony
    </strong>
    , not a Class A misdemeanor, according to a law passed by the Texas Legislature.
   </p>
   <p>
    This legislation was enacted in response to several threats in past years at several universities across the U.S. that disrupted classes and prompted evacuation of campus property, even though the reports turned out to be a hoax.
   </p>
   <p>
    This law relates to the offense of making or causing a false alarm or report involving a public or private institution of higher education. A person commits an offense under Section 42.06,
    <em>
     Texas Penal Code
    </em>
    , if he or she knowingly initiates, communicates or circulates a report of a present, past, or future bombing, fire, offense, or other emergency that he or she knows is false or baseless and that would ordinarily:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Cause action by an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies;
    </li>
    <li>
     Place a person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury; or
    </li>
    <li>
     Prevent or interrupt the occupation of a building, room, place of assembly, place to which the public has access, or aircraft, automobile, or other mode of conveyance.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    An individual adjudged guilty of a state jail felony shall be punished by confinement in a state jail for any term of not more than two years or less than 180 days and, in addition to confinement, may be punished by a fine not to exceed $10,000.
   </p>
   <p>
    UT Dallas students should be aware that the State of Texas takes these threats seriously, and the legal consequences, which are severe, go beyond anything that the University's disciplinary committee can address.
