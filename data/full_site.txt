Graduate applicants must meet both The University of Texas at Dallas graduate school requirements as well as program-specific admission requirements.
We reserve the right to make an admission decision based on an incomplete application whereby the admission committee believes that the candidate is admissible.
Application Requirements
The Admissions Committee will review all applications to guarantee the selection of the most qualified applicants based upon a holistic review of the items listed below:
Personal Objectives Statement
A one-page, double-spaced, typed essay outlining the applicant’s academic interests and goals.
Resume
A detailed resume must be submitted with the online application, or you can upload a copy through the
Admissions Forms folder
in Galaxy. Our Admissions Committee regularly reviews candidates with no work experience on a regular basis, even though work experience is required.
Applicants with No Experience
: Our programs accept a significant number of students without work experience. You can list your academic projects, internships and extra co-curricular achievements from your previous degrees; these can help the Admissions Committee evaluate your candidacy.
Applicants with Work Experience
: A detailed resume of all work history. Internship experiences can also be included here. Your resume can also list academic and extra co-curricular experiences from your previous degrees. Including details that can help the Admissions Committee evaluate your candidacy is recommended.
Transcripts
Domestic applicants must submit transcript copies from all U.S.-based colleges and universities attended, including any graduate program in which the applicant was enrolled for admission.
International applicants and U.S. citizen and permanent resident applicants with an international degree must submit copies of academic documents such as a transcript, diploma, mark sheets, provisional degree certificate and/or your final degree certificate. Applicants who have earned a three-year baccalaureate degree are eligible to apply for admission to UT Dallas graduate programs.
The applicant’s cumulative GPA will be used as a part of the admission committee’s review for competitiveness for admission (currently, the average admitted GPA is 3.3).
Letters of Recommendation
Three letters of recommendation are required, but applicants with two or more years of post-baccalaureate experience will only be required to submit one. At least one of the letters must be from a professional contact, and that contact does not have to be an employer. Letters of recommendation may be submitted through the online letter of recommendation system in the online application, or you can submit a PDF copy via the
Admissions Forms folder
.
Note: Competitive applicant files may be processed before all recommendation letters are received.
English Proficiency
The ability to read, write, speak and understand English is essential for success in graduate studies at UT Dallas. If your native language is not English and you have been educated outside the United States, you must demonstrate English proficiency.
You have met the English proficiency requirement and do not need to submit an English proficiency exam for admission if:
Your bachelor’s or master’s degree (or its equivalent) was earned through instruction and examination in English.
Your native country’s primary language is English. UT Dallas recognizes
English as the primary language of these countries
.
Please review the requirements as outlined on the
Graduate Admission at UT Dallas
page for specifics on scores and potential waivers.
Additional Considerations
While not required as part of the application, the following information may be useful as you move forward in the application process.
Optional GRE/GMAT Test Score
A GRE/GMAT test score is not required, and students have the option to submit a test score if desired. A GRE/GMAT test score will only be used for admission purposes if one is provided by the applicant.
To indicate where the official GMAT score should be sent, please follow the list of
GMAT Program Codes
or, if submitting the GRE, use our GRE School Code: R6897. (No department code is needed)
Scholarships
To be considered for a scholarship,
please submit a Scholarship Application
Submitting Documents
To avoid processing delays, we recommend applying to UT Dallas with unofficial test scores and transcripts. Scanned unofficial copies of your documents can be uploaded using the online application. If you have exhausted your attempts to submit your essay, resume or letter of recommendation using the online application, you may upload a copy through the Admissions Forms folder under Orion Self-Service in Galaxy.
If you have already uploaded a copy using the online graduate application, you do not need to submit another copy in
Galaxy
.
File Requirements for Uploading Documents:
Format: Scanned and saved as a PDF file (photos not acceptable).
If your transcript is issued to you via hard-copy format in a sealed envelope, it is acceptable for you to open it and scan to PDF for upload.
File size should be 10MB or less.
Files cannot be password-protected or have a digital signature.
Upload each document separately.
Resolution should be no more than 300dpi.
Scan in black and white only.
Official copies of your documents should be sent to
UT Dallas
after admission.
Master’s Degree Program Prerequisites
Certain prerequisites are required for graduate programs. Applicants who have not satisfied such requirements may be admitted but will need to satisfy the prerequisites as required by their program.
Credit is not earned for program prerequisites; however, all grades achieved in prerequisites will count toward the student’s cumulative grade-point average (GPA)
. Program prerequisites are outlined in the Catalog within each program’s degree requirements.
Non-Degree-Seeking Students
Students who desire admission as a non-degree-seeking student must meet all the admission requirements specified above for degree-seeking students. Students who decide to switch to degree-seeking status will have to apply to the degree program. If admitted, at most six semester credit hours taken as a non-degree-seeking student can be transferred to the degree program. There are no exceptions to this policy.
Students in the U.S. on an F1 or J1 Visa may only be admitted to degree-seeking status. Please consult with the
International Student Services
if you have doubts concerning your status.

Why choose JSOM for my PhD?
The University of Texas at Dallas is a relatively young university, officially launched in 1969, with the first PhD in management awarded in 1977. The prestige of the program was quickly established, with graduates taking jobs at top-ranked institutions all over the world.
What’s it like to be a PhD student?
Will I receive financial support? Will I have free time? How many hours will be spent on work and classes? Are there any social activities available on campus? These are common questions as students begin the process of applying to a PhD program.
Is a PhD for you?
What does it mean to have a PhD?
Do you want to be your own boss? Have flexible hours designed around your needs? These are a few of the perks when working in academia – you are responsible for your own productivity, on your own schedule.
What makes a perfect PhD programs applicant?
Getting into a good PhD program is a bit like dating. Some programs are attractive but may not be a good fit under the surface. Finding a good match is important. Competition is fierce, and there is no one-size-fits all.
